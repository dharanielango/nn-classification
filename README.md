# Developing a Neural Network Classification Model

## AIM

To develop a neural network classification model for the given dataset.

## Problem Statement

An automobile company has plans to enter new markets with their existing products. After intensive market research, theyâ€™ve decided that the behavior of the new market is similar to their existing market.

In their existing market, the sales team has classified all customers into 4 segments (A, B, C, D ). Then, they performed segmented outreach and communication for a different segment of customers. This strategy has work exceptionally well for them. They plan to use the same strategy for the new markets.

You are required to help the manager to predict the right group of the new customers.

## DESIGN STEPS

1.Import necessary libraries.
2.Load the dataset "customers.csv"
3.Analyse the dataset and drop the rows which has null values.
4.Use encoders and change the string datatypes in the dataset.
5.Calculate correlation matrix ans plot heatmap and analyse the data.
6.Use various visualizations like pairplot,displot,countplot,scatterplot and visualize the data.
7.Split the dataset into training and testing data using train_test_split.
8.Create a neural network model with 2 hidden layers and output layer with four neurons representing multi-classification.
9.Compile and fit the model with the training data
10.Validate the model using training data.
11.Evaluate the model using confusion matrix.
